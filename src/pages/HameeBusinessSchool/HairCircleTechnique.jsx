The circle of friends is equivalent to our medium. How do we brush out different circle of friends, let friends not shield, love to watch and want to see? Today I will tell you how to make friends circle more attractive by adding circles, and add a few fans.</p>

                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>First of all, if you want to send more than 4 pictures at a time, be sure to remember not to send 5, 7 or 8 pictures! Because the picture of a single circle of friends is up to 3 pictures in a row, up to 3 lines, so if you send 5, 7, or 8 pictures, there will be a missing angle, which is very unattractive. This is the rhythm of obsessive-compulsive obsessive-compulsive disorder. .</p>

The image from the material itself is a high force. Then our real shots, we must try to pursue beauty and high requirements. With the picture, the hair circle can add a box with the global Hamee logo on the appearance of the picture, so that the overall look will be more neat and different from other micro-business brush circles. And this is also inadvertently propaganda for yourself, let others remember that you are the sharer of Hamee, so next time he wants to know, maybe the first one will think of you.</p>

                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>The highest level of sales is marketing itself, not marketing products. Of course, products are the basis of sales. We are real selling goods. That is to say, the circle of friends is more about showing yourself, what kind of state are you? You are a treasure mother, or a white, or an inspirational figure who works hard for the cause. These need to be revealed through the circle of friends.</p>

For example, I went to climb a mountain today, and I went to other places to travel with my family today. But to emphasize that there are a lot of treasure moms who like to bask the baby, there is no problem with the baby, but don't send it every day. Seeing your baby's photo several times a month is very cute, it is also a treasure mother. People will interact with you, but if you look at it more and more, you will get bored. All in all, let your circle of friends be able to resonate and interact with others and show others a real life scene. To know that truth brings trust, and trust can bring deals.</p>

Or, we can also ask the topic for help. For example, do the friends in Hangzhou know where the flower market is better? In addition, you can also explore the topic and enhance each other's emotions. For example, for the expectant mother, you can talk to her about some prenatal education, pregnant women, nutrition and so on. There are topics that can make two strangers become semi-acquainted or even acquaintances.</p>

In fact, different WeChat friends can attract different content, but you can't send all of them in one day, and the content that old customers want to see, potential customers will feel annoyed.

                                    <li><p>Intentional customers: You can send product advertisements, sales (but emphasize that you can't get income) to show them, send some good user feedback to them; then you can tell him regularly about some explosive products, highlighting the benefits of the product.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Customers who have not made a deal: The circle of friends that they can see can be life photos, study photos, videos for member training, etc., highlighting changes in your life and making yourself an image of a mentor;</p></li>
