               <p style={styles.pStyle}>In the daily sharing process, did the small partners encounter such a situation, the same is to ask how to do membership, some people talked for more than an hour, the customer has not placed an order, and some people just made a phone call, saying After 10 to 15 minutes, the other party placed the order. Why is this? Let me take everyone together to explore the charm of communication today.</p>

                        <h5>common ways of communicating incorrectly</h5>  
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>First of all, let's look at the common ways of miscommunication. Usually, our novice member partners will enter the following three misunderstandings in the process of communication.</p>                  
                        <ul style={styles.ul_2_Style}>
                            <li>
                                <p>say more questions, do not understand each other's needs</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>pure text expression, long story, is not conducive to reading</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>lack of empathy, can not give customer confidence</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>Whenever you enter these misunderstandings, you will often get a reply from the intended customers: I will consider it, and I will talk to you after considering it. Do you have such a situation in your daily communication process? When someone asks you what questions you have to answer, the answer is that I will consider it, and then many of our members will no longer be able to follow up.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        <h5>understand each other, tap the pain point</h5>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>So how do I communicate with her when I am interested in consulting with clients? Divided into the following 3 points</p>
                        <ul style={styles.ul_2_Style}>
                            <li>
                                <h6>Introduce yourself</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>If there are strangers to consult, it is recommended that the first step is to introduce yourself. Self-introduction, can be sincere, can be authoritative, can highlight identity, all styles can be. The key is to be able to show your personality, to learn to wrap yourself, to extract the most dazzling part of your past experience, and let others feel that you are reliable and credible to follow.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6> understand each other</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>After self-introduction, what we need to do next is to understand each other. We can first define her character by watching her circle of friends. By observing, we have to know her life scene and the circle she is currently in. Next, we have to understand the basic situation of her now through one problem after another.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Refining what we want to know through the answers to the questions. For example: Have you seen my circle of friends done a simple understanding? Have you done any other part-time job besides the global catcher? Let her give us the answer, and then I will know at the end what to use to match the interests of the global catcher.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>excavation pain points</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>After we understand it, we need to find out the other's pain points. Because only if we really understand the customer very deeply, can we touch her to make a certain decision. For example, if we know that the other party is a full-time mother, we know that her pain point is that she has no source of income and she does not want to have another hand. In the up day, then we will tell her that you can only change your status quo if you take this step. If you have been so hesitant, then your future life will always be like this. How painful you are now, how much determination you have to change.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        <h5>answer questions, patiently follow up</h5>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>Here, we have 5 skills, namely: guiding, listening, exhausting, finding out the key, having the picture and the truth.</p>
                        <ul style={styles.ul_2_Style}>
                            <li>
                                <h6>Guide</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>The general guidance is to let the other party say what they really want to say through some open questions. For example, many intent customers will ask such a question. Is our global catcher the same as Weishang? When we encounter such problems, we can first ask each other, dear, what kind of opinion do you think of Weishang? From here we can get a message, the other party has fully recognized the model of our global catcher. We can clearly know where her most tangled points are.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>listening</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>In many cases, we should seriously listen to what the other party is saying, rather than anxious to express ourselves. In reality, most of our members are talking non-stop, rarely to listen to others, or rarely ask others to let others. And often the customer is swaying, and the answer can be drawn during the listening process.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>exhausted</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>We have to ask each other's questions in one go, instead of asking the other person to ask a question, so that the customer gets her answer, but the answer she gave you can only be considered.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>At this time we can ask each other, dear, in addition to this question, what problems do you have? I have been asking the other party to say no, this time you can say, dear, the main question you are considering now is not 123, which lists all her problems. So when we use this skill, we can clearly know what the problem is with the intentional customer, and we can have enough time to think in the process of asking questions. Then you can answer every question of his. When the other party hears your answer, there is no doubt. You should continue to ask her, dear, after I have answered, what problems do you have? ? In the same way, we still have to use an exhaustive method to ask her to ask all the questions.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>find out the key</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>After exhausting the customer's concerns, she still has a lot of questions. At this time, we can't list all her problems as before, but use the fourth technique to find out the key issues. We can ask, dear, what kind of questions do you think are the most important questions, or ask dear, if you solve this problem, you will be registered as a member. If the other party's answer is yes, we will know her key question clearly. If she answers yes, then we know that this is just an excuse for her.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>there are pictures with the truth</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>After the other party asked the question, we must not only have words, but not only voice, but also evidence, evidence is the picture, or video can be sent to her.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        <h5>the door to the door, promote the deal</h5>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>When we finished all the previous things, what we had to do at the end was to make a decision to promote her as a member of the global catcher.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>At this time, you can say this, dear, you registered and told me, I pulled you into our team, there is a course today, or you can join now, you can participate in our members' exclusive access soon. Daily snapped up special promotions to buy explosives at ultra-low prices. You can look for some opportunities to tell her that you have registered today and even now that registration is complete, there will be some good things happening.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>After we kicked the door, some people are definitely registered, and some people are not registered. For those who are not registered, we can also track. For example, some intention customers have clearly told you that they will go without problems. Orders, but in fact have not been placed, this time he still has hesitation factors, but she does not want to tell you, and how you ask, she is not willing to tell you. At this time, we can only speculate on some of the possible entanglements of her. At this time, we can send material about these entangled points in the circle of friends. Here we must emphasize with you that we must learn to directional hair circles and not to show them to everyone. Just send it to her, let her see it alone, high frequency, your income, the team's income, constant hair, the advantages of the global catcher platform, etc., can always stimulate her.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>Well, the sharing of communication skills is here. After mastering the above communication skills, everyone will be able to gain more benefits when they talk about membership, and the benefits will be even higher! I hope that everyone can practice a lot, so that they can constantly break through and improve themselves!</p>
