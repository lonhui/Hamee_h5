                <p style={styles.pStyle}>As the team expands, more and more partners join our Hamee family, and each person is more or less with a heart that wants to change. But sometimes because we are not enough to guide the team leader, I didn't tell him what kind of platform Hamee is, how to use Hamee APP, how to buy it would be more affordable, how to realize social retailing, and so on.</p>
                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Then at this time, we have to reflect on ourselves, whether we want to do some service and give, give something, give cognition and methods. According to our official statistics: all teams that do well, they will pay attention to a job - new training.</p>
                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Then, let's talk about how the new training is organized and how to carry it out!There are three steps to develop a newcomer training camp:</p>

                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>The preparation elements of the training camp in the early stage of the camp are: time, place, people, materials, etc.</p>
                        <ul style={styles.ul_2_Style}>
                            <li>

                                    <li><p>The time here is divided into: camp time training camp cycle training camp frequency</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Opening time: The recommendation is to start every Monday. The teaching time is scheduled to be between 20:00 and 21:00.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Training camp cycle: 7 days recommended. 5 days is a course, 2 days is an interactive punch</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Training Camp Frequency: Determined based on the number of new members in the team. If the team is early, it is recommended to open 1-2 trainings a month.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Training camp, if the team expands rapidly in the later stage, it is recommended to open a training camp once a week.</p></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                <h6>location</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Now is the era of social retail, so the location is on the line, we can pull a group in WeChat: group name is "newcomer training camp", "newcomer flight", etc.</p>

                            <li>

                                <p>The training camp staff includes students and sharing teachers as well as duty officers.</p>
                                <ul style={{listStyle:'disc',paddingInlineStart: 18}}>
                                    <li><p>Participants: Determined by each team based on new members in the team. In principle, there are about 100 students in each training camp. Too many people are not easy to manage, and too few people will give people a feeling of being deserted, which is not conducive to the atmosphere in the group. Of course, depending on your team's situation.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Sharing the teacher: It can be the service provider in the team + yourself and your guide. A total of 5 people are needed. One person one course. This is a great way to set a benchmark for your team and build your team's IP. Mobilize the enthusiasm of everyone.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>On-duty staff: It is to arrange for daily training to be on duty. Work on duty: maintain group atmosphere, as well as punch reminders, homework, etc.</p></li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li><p>Explosive materials: promotional materials, course preparation, rules, commendation preparation</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Promotional materials: You can give your newcomer a poster, which will give you a sense of ritual.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Course preparation: We need to design suitable courses for newcomers</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Rules: Every training must have rules, such as whether you want to hand in homework, whether you want to take a class, and finally how to judge excellence and reward. These must be booked in advance. Here are some examples for everyone.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Commendation preparation: giving gifts</p></li>

                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>In the preparation stage, we will finally talk about how to invite people.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>After determining the time and the mentor, the person's invitation is carried out by the team leaders and the response can be initiated in the group.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>For example, all the excellent Hamee members will hold the Hamee Newcomer Training Camp in xxx (time). We are honored to invite xx big coffee to give us experience sharing. Those who are interested in participating in the training camp will reply directly to the group. I will invite you into the group. The deadline: xxx, the little friends who want to learn are hurrying.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>Of course, if we feel that some people are embarrassed or interested, we can also talk privately.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>For example: Dear, hello, I held a new training session last month, which is very effective. This month I will hold another training camp for new people at xxx (time). This time we invited xx big coffee to train camp to share, so the opportunity is quite rare. I invite you to join the group here, which is very helpful for future business. Please click "1" to participate.</p>

                        <h5>the training camp process</h5>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>The sponsors of this training camp established a training camp (XXX team newcomer camp). All the people who enter the group ask them to change the group nickname (area + nickname + member ID), and when the newcomers enter the group one after another, they can brush the rules within the group from time to time.</p>
                        <p>E.g:</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>Dear students, welcome to the newcomer training camp!</p>
                        <p>Please follow the 5 iron rules below the camp:</p>
                        <ul style={{listStyle:'disc',paddingInlineStart: 18}}>
                            <li><p>Enter the group and immediately modify your group card as: area + nickname + your ID, for example: area + summer +123456</p></li>
                            <li><p>It is strictly forbidden to add friends in the group;</p></li>
                            <li><p>It is strictly forbidden to talk about topics other than Hamee members;</p></li>
                            <li><p>It is strictly forbidden to quarrel and negative energy!</p></li>
                            <li><p>It is strictly forbidden to talk about after sale!</p></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>Once found to be in violation of discipline, immediately take out the group and permanently cancel the qualification to participate in the camp!</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>When we determined that the start time, personnel, tutors, and personnel were all in the group, we could start the new camp.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>The training camp process mainly includes several aspects: mobilization of the camp, esteeming the tutor, sharing of the tutor, and summing up the submissions.</p>
                        <ul style={styles.ul_2_Style}>
                            <li>
                                <h6>open camp</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>When the group members enter the group one after another, they can start the camp time.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>For example: Dear students, our new training camp will officially start in xxx, please participate on time.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>The following is a new man training camp for your reference:</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Good afternoon, everyone in the training camp!</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>I am the initiator of the XXX newcomer training camp and the founder of the XX team. I am very happy to meet you here. From the moment you enter the group, we have a common identity. We are all members of Hamee. As everyone is just on the road to Hamee, some people may be confused and have no direction. I feel that I can't start, I don't know where to start. Then the purpose of this training camp is to solve your doubts, to understand Hamee in more depth, and to learn how to open Hamee.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>respect the mentor</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>The purpose of esteeming the instructor is to increase the authority and influence of the instructor and to help build the personal IP of the instructor. Appropriate respect can help shape relatively serious scenes and form a benign copy. Make the content shared by the instructor more attention.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>For example: Today is also very honored to invite our service provider XX, 10 days to get XX results, good at new powder drainage.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>Instructor sharing</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>The content shared by the instructor is best combined with graphics and text, and a small assignment can be arranged during the sharing process or after the sharing is over. It is not recommended to have interactions in the sharing process here. More than 100 people in the group can send a message to the top of the teacher's content without a trace. Moreover, due to network problems, it is very likely that the interaction link has passed, and the interactive message is inserted when the tutor continues to share.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>It should be noted that as an initiator, it is necessary to control the atmosphere within the group. In the event of a screen shot or a plug-in during the sharing process, it is necessary to stop in time. If there is a violation of the group rules, it needs to be cleaned up in time.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>summary of the words</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>After the instructor has shared it, he needs to thank the tutor. All the students need to write their own sentiments about the course and send them to the group in the form of pictures. If there is a mentor to arrange homework, it is necessary to emphasize the time of handing in and the form of handing over.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>the necessary links</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Be sure to check in five minutes before the class every day, and check the card after the class. In addition, there is a need to have a job link. Here are some passwords for everyone:</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <br/>
                    <li>
                        <h5>the tracking after the training camp</h5>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>After the training camp is over, don't worry about dissolving the training camp. Because of the atmosphere in the group and the sharing of the instructors, the students' heart will also be fermented. After many students have finished listening to the lesson, the chances of becoming a single are very large. Therefore, you can set a reward within the group: from the end of the training camp, all the students who open the order can share their success experience and experience within the group. We will have a mystery prize waiting for you with the most successful partners! The purpose of this is, on the one hand, to make the results of this study visible to everyone, to continue to ferment the results of this training camp, and to stimulate the enthusiasm of other students. On the other hand, it is also to exchange learning and share the successful experience of the students.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>Members who have obtained the first or first few members can also arrange for them to share their experiences in the group. Of course, the mystery award can be a red envelope or an opportunity to have one-on-one communication with the tutor.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>Newcomers are the foundation of every team, no matter who they are, they are stepping from the newcomer to the peak. Therefore, for newcomers, we must give enough patience and care to treat her like an egg that is about to hatch. With your guidance, they will grow faster, fly higher, and run farther.</p>
