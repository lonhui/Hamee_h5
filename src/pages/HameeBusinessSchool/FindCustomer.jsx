                </div>
                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Dear Catcher friends, when you open this document, you must have positioned your "Novice White" character. I hope to learn some methods here, right? Yes, just become a member of the Hamee family, you may be confused, I do not know how to start.</p>
                <p style={styles.pStyle}>It doesn't matter, everything is difficult at the beginning. The first step to developing a good catcher is to expand your friend base and then go to the effective transaction. Any of Hamee's social friends are over the limit, so they will use multiple mobile phones to start work. If your friend base is not much, then this course will definitely help you. Today's course is to help you find your first unfamiliar customers. The course will be explained in two aspects:</p>

                        <h5>how to add new potential customers</h5>
                        <ul style={styles.ul_2_Style}>
                            <li>
                                <h6>The door number or job advertisement of each store</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>When we go to the street to press the road, we often see the format advertisements on the door of the store, there are recruitment, business activities, etc., that number may also be our goal. Since WeChat can be logged in with a mobile number, we can add WeChat by searching for the mobile number.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>What needs to be noticed is that when you search for this WeChat through a mobile phone number, how do we send a verification message to let others pass? Be sure to pay attention when you send a greeting message. Your greeting content must match the content in this store.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>For example: the flower shop door has made a promotion, you can ask: How much is that lily? Or. How is the flower of my brother getting ready to marry a wedding car? If it is a job advertisement, it is said that a certain position is still recruiting people and so on. Send it to him in this way, he will definitely pass. As for whether you are married or not, no one cares.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>the store guide When you go to the store to buy clothes, do you like to buy a set directly in the store or go shopping separately? If you buy it directly in one go, this habit can be changed from now on. If a set of lines is calculated in three pieces, you buy from three different stores, and each store adds two shopping guides, so the three stores are six. As for how to add WeChat as a guide, it is simpler for consumers. For example, today's set is very good. I like this style very much. If you meet the new one for me, you can send me a WeChat notification. ? Or your purpose is not to buy clothes, just to add people. We can say: I didn't find what I like today, but I think the things in your shop are quite in line with my style. If you have the right one next time, can you inform me by sending WeChat? In this way, shopping guides generally do not refuse, because they all need performance to improve their income, and now people who are willing to spend the initiative to ask for WeChat, for them is also a must.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>be an enthusiastic photographer</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>For this, I hope that you can learn some simple photo-taking techniques. There is a photo in the world called a boyfriend. There is a kind of photographer called a boyfriend. Most girls hate it. Clearly one meter and seventy-five, my boyfriend can shoot you one meter five five. Therefore, mastering some simple shooting techniques is also very helpful for us to suck powder.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>If you come across a photo of a boyfriend, or if a passerby needs you to take a photo, we can take the initiative: beauty, your boyfriend may not have a good look, I can help you shoot. If it is equipped, it would be better. If the camera equipment is good, the photo will definitely be better.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>If it is a mobile phone, we must pay attention when we take pictures of others! Be sure to shoot with your own mobile phone, don't shoot with your mobile phone. Because I used her mobile phone to shoot her, after the filming, you said: We add a WeChat, I will send you a photo WeChat.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>become a group of Bai Xiaosheng, a small helper</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Our WeChat is often smashed by various group messages. Many partners are shielded for each group, even directly retreating, what yoga groups, community fruit shop groups, property groups, community owners, etc. The group that is more annoying to others is actually our treasure house for our catchers.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>We are a good way to add people in the group. Take the example of the community owner group: the group owner group is almost all the owners of the community, in other words, the neighbors. Then please be careful, don't add people as soon as you enter the group, it is easy to be disgusted. Moreover, for them, you are a stranger or you don't know you at all. If you come up and add me, the purpose is very strong, and others will be very disgusted.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>We must pay attention when we add people to the group. We don't blindly go to add people directly. First of all, mix in the group and participate in the discussion within the group, it is best to properly solve one or two small problems raised by others. For example, there are owners in the group who proposed that the kitchen knife at home is blunt. You can participate: our family has to grind, just tomorrow I have a sharp knife master to come to the door, the neighbors in need can go to xx place or my home to grind together. Then you will add his WeChat, then she will definitely pass your WeChat certification. Therefore, if you want to add people in the group, you must have had a chat, based on a basic communication, so that you can go to add people, the pass rate is very high.</p>

                        <h5>how to effectively deal with customers</h5>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>When we accumulate our WeChat friends, how do we make them our customers? Next, let's take a look at how to do it one by one!</p>
                        <ul style={styles.ul_2_Style}>
                            <li>
                                <h6>the list of columns</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>List our business cards, WeChat friends, mobile phone contacts, and friends in social software, and then segment them according to what we know about them. There are three types, one is self-purchasing, one is sharing, and the other is project expansion.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Self-purchasing type: he will buy it himself, have the ability to consume, buy and buy is her daily routine. Then we recommend the catcher to him, because the catcher is an additional shopping app for her. And compared to other APP, not only the price is lower, but also to ensure the authentic original factory, in addition to the service of buying expensive double compensation. For such a gangster, this temptation is almost deadly!</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Sharing type: His circle of friends is very active. He is a very sociable person. Then we can tell him that the catcher can not only save you money, but also you can use it as a social currency in your daily sharing process. In the meantime, I can earn pocket money. This general situation will touch her in this way.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Project expansion: What is project expansion? In fact, it is quite broad! For example, in our circle of friends, there will be micro-business, open physical stores, direct sales, etc. These people can use the catcher as a project and stack it up. Can also expand on each other, can be done very very large! Because the catcher is actually equivalent to managing the company, managing its own community, managing the team, managing new people, and managing the dark horse. So this is also a challenge for many entrepreneurs to do business.</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>So be sure to remember the three types of lists and list the types you need.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>set the task</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>The task, in fact, the task at the beginning is: How many people do I need to share every day! My goal is to have several members every day and then reach! Going to the next one, how many people to help become a service provider, etc., once the goal is reached. When we don't have a goal, we actually do everything like a headless fly. I don't know what I should do today. Many times the reason why we can't do it is because there is no goal.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>tagging</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>There is also a small trick, tagging, very critical. The principle of labeling, based on statistics, allows us to easily identify at a glance! For example: in her WeChat, change the remarks next to it, the number of communication, the number of consultations, the number of orders, and even whether the app has been downloaded can be used as a label to remark. The purpose of the remark is to facilitate communication with them next time. There are places to cut in.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>good at observation</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Before we communicate with a person, we must analyze clearly, his personality preferences and his circles. The circle of friends is the best way to understand a person. Look at his circle of friends. It is probably a matter of one person. You can even observe it. For example, observe a treasure mother, how old her child is, and what milk powder she should drink. . You can also observe a girl who loves makeup, then she should need cosmetics, and the beauty products of the catcher are worth recommending. Cut in from different points, because thousands of people face each other, the way everyone communicates is actually different. As long as you find the point of interest to the other party, you can conduct a good digging!</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>empathy</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Be sure to consider the problem from the perspective of the other party. For example, there is a micro-business at this time, and you want to talk to him. He has been in your circle for a long time, you are even a friend with him. But when you come up, tell him that the era of Weishang has passed. Don't do micro-business again. You should run the catcher with me... At this time, he will definitely close the door, and even if you have problems! Therefore, we must consider the problem from the perspective of the other side and help the other party to think clearly. Then go to communicate with the other party, so that it is possible to succeed, and sometimes others do not understand, it does not matter, because we have to allow everyone to have room for improvement, he may not communicate this time, and may succeed next time.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p style={styles.pStyle}>As the saying goes, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. The first step towards success is extremely important for the catchers. I hope that the content of this course will allow you to take the first step steadily and open a new career.</p>
