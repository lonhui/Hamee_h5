                <p>First of all, let's take a look at the benefits of pushing:</p>

                                <h6>Target determination</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Actions without goals, like the same unmanned boat, wandering aimlessly. The last one did nothing. Then in order to realize the value of the push we need</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Target quantification; refers to what results are to be achieved in the push activities. For example, how many people will add WeChat in a certain amount of time, and how many customers will be converted into your membership. Of course, the requirements of each side need to be reasonable; don't be too high-spirited, and don't be arrogant. Set a goal that is one level higher than what you expect to achieve. For example, if you expect to add more than 100 people to WeChat, then you will set a goal of adding 120 people to WeChat. In addition, according to the target, a corresponding amount of promotional materials can be provided. (more than 20% principle)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>Site preparation</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Opening a store to do business, site selection is the first major factor to consider. Because the site selection is good, the flow of people and customers will be more, the business is naturally better. The same push is also required to select the location, the location is well selected not only to avoid being demolished by security but also to attract more interested fans. So, is there any skill in selecting a site? Here is a summary for everyone:</p>
                                <ul style={{listStyle:'disc',paddingInlineStart: 18}}>
                                    <li><p>First, choose where the traffic is high.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Second, find places where the audience of our platform is highly concentrated, such as Bao Ma, white-collar workers, and places where women are concentrated.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Third, the place you choose must be within the jurisdiction of urban management.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Fourth, you can choose some places where there are more entrepreneurs. Because the purpose of doing our push is not to sell one or two products, we are to attract fans, in order to fission, this must be kept in mind, so entrepreneurs are also our potential development targets.</p></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Then the above is the idea of site selection for everyone to push, many friends will think, then where can I specifically find?</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>I also provide some specific choices for everyone here, everyone can go to study. For example, we can go to the university campus to do activities to find college students, or you can go to the talent market to attract people who are looking for a job. You can also choose to go downstairs to do activities to attract female white-collar workers. If you want to go to the office building, you are advised to go to the entrance of the canteen at the lunchtime or at the entrance of the restaurant. This time is a female white-collar worker and everyone has a leisure time at noon to listen to your recommendation. . If you go to the office building, you must have noon. It is not recommended to go in the morning or at night. In addition, we can also choose the residential gate or community plaza, as well as maternal and child supplies stores, infant early childhood education centers, playgrounds, etc. These areas are mainly attracted. The object is the treasure mother. In addition to this, you can also choose the shopping center plaza, the supermarket gate, the traffic on the flyover in the city center, etc. But there is one thing you must remember. No matter where you choose to push, you must negotiate with the relevant management office such as security, property or school in advance. Otherwise, half of it will be demolished, and our positive heart will be wasted. Things, right!</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>The above is some precautions about the location of the ground push. Next, let's talk about the material preparation before the push.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>Material preparation</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>We mainly need to prepare four materials, namely global materials, product materials, experience materials and gifts materials that we have prepared for powder absorption.</p>
                                <ul style={{listStyle:'disc',paddingInlineStart: 18}}>
                                    <li><p>Global materials: tablecloths, aprons (according to the number of people), work permits, a pack of balloons, and a brochure. Advertising umbrella (large)</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Product materials: mainly based on hot products on the platform, such as Kangbach's pot, latex pillow, a set of skin care products or self-heating hot pot, etc. You personally think that you sell the most convenient products, homemade leaflets.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Experience materials: Hamee paper towels, Hamee snacks or yogurt, fruit, etc.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Gift materials: follow three principles. First, the cost is lower but more practical, such as Hamee paper towels, small mirrors, and hair ropes. Then, vote for it, that is, the target group is interested, or is more popular nowadays, such as balloons, small windmills (children), such as the grass clips that have been used for a long time (on the head); Flexibility, timely adjustment based on factors such as season, target group and activity time.</p></li>
                                </ul>

                                <h6>Propaganda preparation</h6>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Because everyone's local push is not big, so we can push the day to carry out propaganda and distribute the discount card (the coupon card must be printed with its own WeChat QR code)</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>When we build the ground, we need to start pushing activities. What should we do in the push activities?</p>

                                <h6>The first thing we need to do is to drain, here are a few ways to introduce you.</h6>
                                <p>First, the drainage of words (that is, using words to gather people together)</p>
                                <p>Key points: the attraction is attractive, there are benefits, using free gifts and star effects</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>The first thing we need to do is to drain, here are a few ways to introduce you.</h6>
                                <p>First, the drainage of words (that is, using words to gather people together)</p>
                                <p>Key points: the attraction is attractive, there are benefits, using free gifts and star effects</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>The second type: send a single stream (that is, send a single page to lead people)</h6>
                                <p>Key points: send a single, speech,</p>
                                <p>Summary: The eyes should be sharp, the hands should be fast, and the words should be streamlined.</p>
                                <p>For example, dear, Hamee member xx area to do activities, with a single page can go to push the red envelope or receive a pack of paper towels.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>The third type: gift drainage</h6>
                                <p>The key point: find the right target, the gift is attractive.</p>
                                <p>We can attract with mineral water, because summer water still works.</p>
                                <p>Or we can use a photo printer to print photos as a gift (that is, we can prepare a photo printer, just scan the QR code and print a photo of the phone for free)</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h6>The fourth type: red envelope drainage,</h6>
                                <p>We can prepare some red envelopes with 5 yuan and 1 piece of money, or put a homemade product coupon inside to tell you to add a red envelope if you add a QR code. (This works well and costs a little)</p>
                                <p>Everyone should pay attention to the fact that the drainage of words, the flow of singles and the drainage of gifts are not isolated. In the push of the earth, we must combine the four together and use them flexibly. The above is a set of drainage methods, which will attract customers to our promotion station in the future. This method is more suitable for use in places with high traffic. But for people with less traffic, what about us? We can use a slow speed service to add powder. For example, sweep the QR code for free eyebrows or free studio nails in a week (this requires you to have this skill, don't be hard on it. If you don't have this skill, you can let the team have this aspect. Talented person oh)</p> 
                                <p>In addition to drainage, we may encounter some problems in the push. Then let me give you some common questions.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>such as:</p>

                                <p>What is Hamee?</p>
                                <p style={styles.pStyle}>Then we can answer: Hamee is the same mobile Internet mobile APP supermarket as Jingdong and Tmall. But there is a difference between the traditional e-commerce, you can save money by buying it, and you can make money by buying it. It is a platform for shopping and creating opportunities for yourself. You see the milk powder of the children you eat at home. Come to see our app.</p>

                        <h5>post-push maintenance</h5>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>After adding fans, avoid others quickly deleting us. We need to send a message to him to convey the points of interest that you can get with WeChat.</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>Words: Dear, I am Hamee's service provider xx, I am very happy to be a social friend with you. My circle of friends will not only offer special discount products every day, but also have red packets and product free activities every week. You bring more benefits and joy. I hope you have been paying attention! Grateful to meet!</p>
                        <p style={styles.pStyle}>Tips: The purpose of the push is not to sell products, but to divert fans and better achieve team fission. Therefore, we added WeChat in the process of pushing the ground, and we must track and maintain interaction in the later stage.</p>
